## English words commonly used in GRE 

The words that are commonly used in the GRE exam are scraped from the web
[GRE_WORDS](https://www.graduateshotline.com/gre-word-list.html)

These words are then put into a csv file from where a word is chosen at random and the word alongside its meaning pops up as a notification on the computer

This can be particularly useful for the people who want to learn a new word every day as the script can be run by the task scheduler in windows at any given time of the day
